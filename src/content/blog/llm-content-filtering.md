Hey Tech Enthusiasts!

Did you know that it's possible to add content filters (or as I like to call them, hashtag#security layers) to large language models? Let's dive into the world of moderation models and how they play a crucial role in ensuring safe and relevant conversations in AI-driven chat applications.

## 🧠 Understanding Language Dynamics:

Imagine a scenario where you make a request to a chat application, like hashtag#OpenChatKit, powered by the open source model GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B. To ensure that this application only serves legitimate requests, we introduce a security layer in the form of GPT-JT (6B).

GPT-JT (6B) comprehends human language nuances, effectively filtering out inappropriate or irrelevant content. This understanding of language dynamics is the first line of defense in maintaining a safe environment.

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition:

Adding a CHECK before hitting OpenChatKit allows us to screen the request through GPT-JT (6B), which excels at pattern recognition. It identifies and filters content deviating from predefined standards, ensuring adherence to community guidelines. This step further enhances the moderation process.

## ⚡ Real-time Moderation:

Operating swiftly, GPT-JT (6B) provides real-time moderation, ensuring that the chat application maintains a safe environment for users. In the dynamic landscape of AI-driven conversations, real-time moderation is crucial to address emerging issues promptly.

In this era of advanced chat applications, powered by models like GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B, implementing GPT-JT (6B) as a moderation layer is crucial. This concise post emphasizes how GPT-JT (6B) acts as a robust content filter, ensuring safety and domain-specific relevance in the dynamic AI-driven conversation landscape. 🌐✨

In an upcoming post, I will demonstrate this concept using a custom application. Stay tuned!
