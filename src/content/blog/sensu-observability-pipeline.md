Hey Tech Enthusiasts!

Have you ever heard of an Observability Pipeline, Sensu, or the term Observability as Code? 🚀** 🔍

In this series on Site Reliability, I've been delving into tools SREs use to ensure applications and infrastructure are not only highly available and reliable but also bolstered by robust Observability and Monitoring solutions.

## 🔍 Observability Pipeline Overview:

Embark on a fascinating tour of the Observability Pipeline – a pivotal player in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), now introducing Observability as Code. This revolutionary, code-driven approach empowers your infrastructure with real-time insights.

### 💡 What is it?

Observability as Code enables you to define, deploy, and manage your observability stack using code. Today, I'm unveiling a basic setup featuring a dynamic duo - Sensu-backend and Sensu-agent, creating a robust observability platform.

### 🔄 Continuous Improvement:

Witness the marvel of CI/CD! Our GitHub Action CICD pipeline seamlessly updates the Observability Pipeline using httpie and JSON-formatted events – automation at its finest.

### 🖥️ Screenshots Galore:
