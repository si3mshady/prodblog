Hey there! I'm Elliott Arnold, and this is my little corner of the internet. By day, I'm knee-deep in the world of AWS, Site Reliability Engineering, and all things Cloud Tech. I have a soft spot for Entrepreneurship, and my curiosity extends to the skies with Drones and AI, especially large language models (LLM).

Outside the tech buzz, you'll find me chasing the perfect swing on the golf course, casting lines for the next big catch, jet-setting to new destinations, and sharing moments with some four-legged pals. Join me as I navigate the realms of passion, innovation, and the simple joys of life. It's a bit of tech, a dash of leisure, and a whole lot of exploration!
